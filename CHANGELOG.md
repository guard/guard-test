## 0.4.0 - September 29, 2011 - ([@rymai][])

### Regression:

- Removed support of [turn](https://github.com/guard/guard-spork) gem since "Turn is no longer compatible with TestUnit 2.0+. TestUnit and MiniTest are deverging and after some consideration it was decided that Turn's goal is to support Ruby's native test framework, whatever it may be." quoted from Turn's [release.txt](https://github.com/TwP/turn/blob/master/Release.txt).

### New feature:

- New `:drb` option enabling the use of [`spork-testunit`](https://github.com/timcharper/spork-testunit) gem (be sure to use [guard-spork](https://github.com/guard/guard-spork) as well).

## 0.3.1 - September 11, 2011

### New feature:

### Regression:

- Turn doesn't want to run, so remove sentences that say that it is supported for now. Note: The code is still here, only the command line doesn't seem to output anything...

## 0.3.0.rc2 - June 2, 2011 - ([@rymai][])

### New features:

- New `:cli` option (nil by default) to pass arbitrary CLI arguments to the Ruby/Turn command that runs the tests.
- New `:notification` option (true by default) to disable notification (Growl/Inotify).
- New `:all_on_start` option (true by default) to not run all the tests at startup.
- New `:all_after_pass` option (true by default) to run all tests after changed tests pass.
